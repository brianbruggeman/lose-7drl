LOSE: A 7drl Entry for 2017
===========================


The Land of Software Engineering
--------------------------------

Armed with only a pocket protector and a single punch card, your
character finds itself within its own software and must eventually merge
with the machine or die trying.  The Manager might stalk you, and the
newbie might slow you down, but beware of the gamer in disguised dressed
as a programmer giving false advice!  The acolytes of software languages
will attempt to convert your character to follow the one true software
paradigm.  There are spaces and tabs and missing semi-colons.  Coffee is
the one true weapon (outside of the mountainous dew) for powering
through meetings, infinite recursion and race conditions.
